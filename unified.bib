abstract={Driven by the increasing demand for micro-/nano-technologies, stimuli-responsive shape memory materials at nanoscale have recently attracted great research interests. However, by reducing the size of conventional shape memory materials down to approximately nanometre range, the shape memory effect diminishes. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we report the discovery of a shape memory effect in a two-dimensional atomically thin graphene oxide crystal with ordered epoxy groups, namely C8O. A maximum recoverable strain of 14.5{\%} is achieved as a result of reversible phase transition between two intrinsically stable phases. Our calculations conclude co-existence of the two stable phases in a coherent crystal lattice, giving rise to the possibility of constructing multiple temporary shapes in a single material, thus, enabling highly desirable programmability. With an atomic thickness, excellent shape memory mechanical properties and electric field stimulus, the discovery of a two-dimensional shape memory graphene oxide opens a path for the development of exceptional micro-/nano-electromechanical devices.},

To overcome this limitation, the replacement of C=C bonds by isostructural and isoelectronic bonds is emerging as an effective
strategy to open a band gap in monoatomic graphene layers. First prepared by Stock and Pohland in 1926, borazine is the isoelectronic and isostructural inorganic analogue of benzene, where the C=C bonds are replaced by BN couples. The strong polarity of the BN bonds widens the molecular
HOMOLUMO gap, imparting strong UV-emission/absorption and electrical insulating properties. These properties make borazine a valuable molecular scaffold to be inserted as doping units in graphitic-based carbon materials to tailor a relevant band gap. It is with this objective that we
became interested in the development of new synthetic organic methodologies to gain access to functionalized borazine derivatives. In particular, we have described the synthesis of borazine derivatives that, featuring aryl substituents at the B-centers bearing ortho-functionalities,
are exceptionally stable against hydrolysis. Building on these structural motifs, we prepared hybrid BN-doped polyphenylene nanostructures featuring controlled doping patterns, both as dosage and orientation. Finally, exploiting the Friedel-Craft electrophilic aromatic substitution, we could
develop the first rational synthesis of the first soluble hexa-peri-hexabenzoborazinocoronene and measured its optoelectronic properties, showing a widening of its gap compared to its full-carbon congener."

In this work, the shape memory vapor grown carbon fiber/graphene oxide/epoxy (VGCF/GO/EP) were prepared, and the thermodynamic coupling behaviors and the energy harvesting property of the composites were investigated via homemade evaluation apparatus, respectively. The experimental results showed that the addition of VGCF-GO fillers can effectively improve the thermal response recovery rate of EP in the stretching stage below the strain of approximately 10%. At 10% pre-strain, the maximum thermal response recovery rate of the VGCF/GO/EP composites was 57%, 158%, and 22% higher than that of the pristine EP, GO/EP composites, and VGCF/EP composites, respectively. The synergistic effect of VGCF and GO significantly improves the output work of the EP films, and the VGCF/GO/EP composite films can easily lift 300 g weight under 30% pre-strain. Especially under 100 g load, the VGCF/GO/EP composite films can stably output up to 275 J kg−1 work in the heating and cooling cycle (40 °C–95 °C). Furthermore, the VGCF/GO/EP composite films and piezoelectric ceramic (PZTC) were combined to form a thermal energy collector, which realized the conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy. The thermal energy collectors can output 1.5 V peak voltage under the ambient temperature change of 40 °C–90 °C.}

Apart from this, the periodic injection of O in graphene (C4O) opens a small band gap (0.6 eV) while keeps the Dirac cone. The adsorption of Li-ions makes it metallic by donating an extra electron to the UGO monolayer. The UGO monolayer can have a high Li storage capacity of 419 mAh/g and a typical anodic open circuit voltage range of 0.94–0.19 V. The energy barrier for Li migration is almost double of the pristine graphene, which results from the localized positive charge regions in the UGO monolayer.}

Nonvolatile memories (NVMs) are making inroads into high-capacity storage to replace hard disk drives, fuelling the expansion of the global storage memory market. As silicon-based flash memories are approaching their fundamental limit, vertical stacking of multiple memory cell layers, innovative device concepts, and novel materials are being investigated. In this context, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black phosphorous, offer a host of physical and chemical properties, which could both improve existing memory technologies and enable the next generation of low-cost, flexible, and wearable storage devices. Herein, an overview of graphene and related 2D materials (GRMs) in different types of NVM cells is provided, including resistive random-access, flash, magnetic and phase-change memories. The physical and chemical mechanisms underlying the switching of GRM-based memory devices studied in the last decade are discussed. Although at this stage most of the proof-of-concept devices investigated do not compete with state-of-the-art devices, a number of promising technological advancements have emerged. Here, the most relevant material properties and device structures are analyzed, emphasizing opportunities and challenges toward the realization of practical NVM devices.},

The electrical conductivity of the composites was tested by the four-probe method, and the results suggested that the conductivity of the samples was significantly increased by the presence of MWCNTs. The conductivity reached 35 S/m when the MWCNT loading was 9 wt\%. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed that the composites exhibited higher storage moduli than pure SMP. In addition, the shielding effectiveness (SE) of composites with various MWCNT loading and thickness were measured over 4–7 and 13–16 GHz. The highest SE achieved was close to 35 dB for MWCNT/SMP composites with the thickness of 2 mm and MWCNT loading of 9 wt\%. The SE increased as the thickness and conductivity of the composites increased. Moreover, the SE was enhanced as the frequency increased. }

Usually the framework returns to its original shape when the guests desorb. Sakata et al. (p. 193) noted that because surface stress drives this process, it might be avoided in smaller crystals. Indeed, a flexible porous coordination polymer, [Cu2(dicarboxylate)2(amine)]n, could retain the structure induced by guest molecules such as methanol if crystallites were made sufficiently small (submicrometer scale) and did so to a greater degree as the crystallite dimensions decreased.Flexible porous coordination polymers change their structure in response to molecular incorporation but recover their original configuration after the guest has been removed. We demonstrated that the crystal downsizing of twofold interpenetrated frameworks of [Cu2(dicarboxylate)2(amine)]n regulates the structural flexibility and induces a shape-memory effect in the coordination frameworks. In addition to the two structures that contribute to the sorption process (that is, a nonporous closed phase and a guest-included open phase), we isolated an unusual, metastable open dried phase when downsizing the crystals to the mesoscale, and the closed phase was recovered by thermal treatment. Crystal downsizing suppressed the structural mobility and stabilized the open dried phase. The successful isolation of two interconvertible empty phases, the closed phase and the open dried phase, provided switchable sorption properties with or without gate-opening behavior.},

abstract={Many established, but also potential future applications of NiTi-based shape memory alloys (SMA) in biomedical devices and solid-state refrigeration require long fatigue life with 107--109 duty cycles1,2. However, improving the fatigue resistance of NiTi often compromises other mechanical and functional properties3,4. Existing efforts to improve the fatigue resistance of SMA include composition control for coherent phase boundaries5--7 and microstructure control such as precipitation8,9 and grain-size reduction3,4. Here, we extend the strategy to the nanoscale and improve fatigue resistance of NiTi via a hybrid heterogenous nanostructure. We produced a superelastic NiTi nanocomposite with crystalline and amorphous phases via severe plastic deformation and low-temperature annealing. The as-produced nanocomposite possesses a recoverable strain of 4.3{\%} and a yield strength of 2.3{\thinspace}GPa. In cyclic compression experiments, the nanostructured NiTi micropillars endure over 108 reversible-phase-transition cycles under a stress of 1.8{\thinspace}GPa. We attribute the enhanced properties to the mutual strengthening of nanosized amorphous and crystalline phases where the amorphous phase suppresses dislocation slip in the crystalline phase while the crystalline phase hinders shear band propagation in the amorphous phase. The synergy of the properties of crystalline and amorphous phases at the nanoscale could be an effective method to improve fatigue resistance and strength of SMA.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart materials with light-actuated shape memory effects are developed from renewable resources in this work. Bio-based benzoxazine resin is prepared from vanillin, furfurylamine, and paraformaldehyde by utilizing the Mannich-like condensation. Vanillin-furfurylamine-containing benzoxazine resin (V-fa) is subsequently copolymerized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO). When the copolymer is reinforced with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the resulting composite exhibits shape memory effects. Molecular characteristics of V-fa resin, ECO, and V-fa/ECO copolymers are obtained from Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Curing behavior of V-fa/ECO copolymers is investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Dynamic mechanical properties of MWCNT reinforced V-fa/ECO composites are determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Morphological details and distribution of MWCNTs within the copolymer matrix are characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Shape memory performances of MWCNT reinforced V-fa/ECO composites are studied by shape memory tests performed with a universal testing machine. After a significant deformation to a temporary shape, the composites can be recovered to the original shape by near-infrared (NIR) laser actuation. The shape recovery process can be stimulated at a specific site of the composite simply by focusing NIR laser to that site. The shape recovery time of the composites under NIR actuation is four times faster than the shape recovery process under conventional thermal activation. Furthermore, the composites possess good shape fixity and good shape recovery under NIR actuation.},

ABSTRACT={Using nanoscience to solve the issues that limit the development of a sustainable society is one of the most important topics at present. Sustainable polymers play an important role in the construction of a sustainable society, but its large-scale application is usually limited by the poor mechanical and shape-memory properties of the commonly used epoxy resin. The utilization of nanoarchitectures to improve the shape-memory performance of composite materials is an effective approach. Graphene, among the used reinforcement materials for epoxy resin, is undoubtedly a fascinating example. In this paper, the shape-memory and mechanical properties of graphene-modified epoxy resins are described respectively for different response types. In this mini-review, we present an overview of the research results of graphene nanoarchitectonics in the modification of shape-memory epoxy resin composites. Besides, this paper has reviewed the properties of different types of graphene/epoxy composites, looking forward to the development of graphene/epoxy composites and future prospects.}

The Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the chemical structure of nanocomposite films. The properties of nanocomposite films were verified by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile test, and the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The shape memory properties were studied through various thermomechanical cycles applied by the DMA apparatus. All the nanocomposite films showed larger glassy storage moduli compared with those of the neat PU films. The nanocomposite film containing 0.25wt.\% GNPs showed the highest shape recovery ratio (92.4\%) since the net-point effect of GNPs dominates its slipping effect. While for the other nanocomposite films the slippage effect overcomes the net-point effect.},

Firstly, the shape memory behavior of the synthesized nanocomposite samples is inspected utilizing the DMA technique. It is demonstrated that despite the monotonic increase of the shape fixity ratio with the nanofiller loading, there exists a peak in the values of shape recovery at the optimum value of graphene content. In good agreement with our experimental measurements, molecular dynamics simulation approach yields the same optimum amount of graphene content. To explore the underlying mechanism, we further proceed to numerically analyze the variations of the conformational entropy, potential energy, and the radius of gyration during the whole procedure. The results reveal that while the shape fixity is significantly affected by both the potential energy and entropy changes, the shape recovery is only under the influence of the conformational entropy.}

abstract={In this work, the effect of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the thermally induced shape memory properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was studied. rGO was incorporated within PLA at various contents (0.1--1.0mass{\%}) by melt-extrusion. X-ray diffraction showed that PLA/rGO nanocomposites presented decreased crystallinity compared to PLA alone. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that rGO particles favored the formation of more imperfect PLA crystals. Results from thermogravimetric analyses showed that the PLA/rGO composites presented slightly improved thermal stability. Time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance indicated increased molecular mobility for PLA/rGO nanocomposites in relation to PLA. Dynamic mechanical analysis results showed that Tg{\thinspace}={\thinspace}62.9{\textdegree}C for PLA and that this value was reduced for the composites, reaching 54.2{\textdegree}C when the rGO content was 1.0mass{\%}. The storage moduli (E{\textasciiacutex}) were reduced with the increase in rGO content, with a 44{\%} decrease for the composition with 1.0 mass{\%} of rGO. However, above 65{\textdegree}C the E{\textasciiacutex} values increased substantially, which suggested the role of graphene to fix the heat-relaxed molecules of PLA. For the composites, the thermally induced shape memory data revealed an increase in the maximum strain ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}varepsilon{\_}{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}m{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}), reaching 39{\%} and 51{\%} for the composites with the incorporation of rGO at 0.5 and 1.0mass{\%} content, respectively.

ABSTRACT = {Shape memory behavior of crystalline shape memory polyurethane (SPU) reinforced with graphene, which utilizes melting temperature as a shape recovery temperature, was examined with various external actuating stimuli such as direct heating, resistive heating, and infrared (IR) heating. Compatibility of graphene with crystalline SPU was adjusted by altering the structure of the hard segment of the SPU, by changing the structure of the graphene, and by changing the preparation method of the graphene/SPU composite. The SPU made of aromatic 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MSPU) exhibited better compatibility with graphene, having an aromatic structure, compared to that made of the aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate. The finely dispersed graphene effectively reinforced MSPU, improved shape recovery of MSPU, and served effectively as a filler, triggering shape recovery by resistive or IR heating. Compatibility was enhanced when the graphene was modified with methanol. This improved shape recovery by direct heating, but worsened the conductivity of the composite, and consequently the efficiency of resistive heating for shape recovery also declined. Graphene modified with methanol was more effective than pristine graphene in terms of shape recovery by IR heating.},

The superelasticity and high strength, together with good electrical conductivity, of the graphene sponge imparted the graphene/polymer hybrid films with fast recoverable shape-memory properties. Various droplets could slip on the compressed film with a lubricant-covered surface, but the droplets would be pinned when the shape-memory graphene film rebounded due to electrical stimulation, which caused the penetration of the infused lubricant into the pores and the exposure of rough topography film surfaces.

In this respect, shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted much attention due to their advantages over metals in terms of weight and reliability. However, they are still marred by slow reaction times and poor mechanical performance. In this work we show how, by integrating a graphene network in a SMP matrix, it is possible to create composites with very low carbon contents (below 1wt%) able to change shapes in short times (10s of seconds) in response to low electric voltages (<10V). This is possible because the conductive network is highly interconnected at the microscopic scale, acting as a very efficient Joule heater. The composites exhibit excellent shape fixity (>0.95±0.03) and shape recovery ratios (>0.98±0.03). Due to the 2D nature of graphene, this network directs crack propagation during fracture resulting in materials that retain bending strengths close to 100MPa and exhibit significant extrinsic toughening (with toughness that reach values up to 3 times the initiation value). Furthermore, changes in conductivity can be used to follow the formation and growth of damage in the material before catastrophic failure, allowing the use of this material as a damage sensor. These results provide practical guidelines for the design of reliable shape memory composites for structural and sensing applications.}

Technological uses range from durable, shape-recovery eye-glass frames, to temperature-sensitive switches, to the generation of stress to induce mechanical motion3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here, we demonstrate that the uniform dispersion of 1--5 vol.{\%} of carbon nanotubes in a thermoplastic elastomer yields nanocomposites that can store and subsequently release, through remote means, up to 50{\%} more recovery stress than the pristine resin. The anisotropic nanotubes increase the rubbery modulus by a factor of 2 to 5 (for 1--5 vol.{\%}) and improve shape fixity by enhancing strain-induced crystallization. Non-radiative decay of infrared photons absorbed by the nanotubes raises the internal temperature, melting strain-induced polymer crystallites (which act as physical crosslinks that secure the deformed shape) and remotely trigger the release of the stored strain energy. Comparable effects occur for electrically induced actuation associated with Joule heating of the matrix when a current is passed through the conductive percolative network of the nanotubes within the resin. This unique combination of properties, directly arising from the nanocomposite morphology, demonstrates new opportunities for the design and fabrication of stimuli-responsive polymers, which are otherwise not available in one material system.},

The dependence of different boundary conditions on the microstructure morphology has been examined energetically. The tensile tests on rectangular prism nanowires, using the displacement based loading, demonstrate the shape memory effect and pseudoelastic behavior.

Using zirconium as a model system, for which an adequate semiempirical potential describing the phase transformation process is lacking, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the ML-AIMD interatomic potential correctly captures the energetics and structural transformation properties of zirconium as compared to experimental and density-functional data for phonons, elastic constants, as well as stacking fault energies. Molecular dynamics simulations successfully reproduce the transformation mechanisms and reasonably map out the pressure--temperature phase diagram of zirconium.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to provide new insight into the dynamic thermo-mechanical properties of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanowires subjected to multi-axial loadings. The phase-field model with Ginzburg--Landau energy, having appropriate strain based order parameter and strain gradient energy contributions, is used to study the martensitic transformations in the representative 2D square-to-rectangular phase transformations for FePd SMA nanowires. The microstructure and mechanical behavior of martensitic transformations in SMA nanostructures have been studied extensively in the literature for uniaxial loading, usually under isothermal assumptions. The developed model describes the martensitic transformations in SMAs based on the equations for momentum and energy with bi-directional coupling via strain, strain rate and temperature. These governing equations of the thermo-mechanical model are numerically solved simultaneously for different external loadings starting with the evolved twinned and austenitic phases. We observed a strong influence of multi-axial loading on dynamic thermo-mechanical properties of SMA nanowires. Notably, the multi-axial loadings are quite distinct as compared to the uniaxial loading case, and the particular axial stress level is reached at a lower strain. The SMA behaviors predicted by the model are in qualitative agreements with experimental and numerical results published in the literature. The new results reported here on the nanowire response to multi-axial loadings provide new physical insight into underlying phenomena and are important, for example, in developing better SMA-based MEMS and NEMS devices},

The hysteresis and phase transformations are governed by the kinetic phase evolution equation using the scalar order parameter, laws of conservation of the momentum and energy and a nonlinear coupling of the stress, the strain and the order parameter in a differential form. One of the important features of the model is that the phase transformation is governed by the stress tensor, as opposed to the transformation strain tensor typically used in the literature. The model takes into account different properties of austenite and martensite phases based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress.

They are based on the Ginzburg–Landau free energy and the phase field theory. The core of the models is a phase evolution governed by the time dependent Ginzburg–Landau (TDGL) equation and the conservation balance laws with nonlinear coupling between stress, strain and the phase order parameter. The models account for the gradient energy and have been tested in the study of material properties evolution under harmonic stress loading for all important practical cases. The representative numerical simulations have been carried out here without the gradient energy term. The developed models account for the phase dependent properties based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress. We also compared the results obtained with these models and observed differences in homogeneous and inhomogeneous situations due to the change in compliance.

abstract = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) is one of the novel advanced functional materials that has an increasing range of current and potential applications, including smart materials and structures, bio-medical and nanotechnologies. This range includes also applications of SMA for control and vibration tuning of various structures, seismic response mitigation, and others. In vibration tuning in many of these applications, it is often necessary to apply supplementary oscillators to absorb the vibration energy input into the primary system. Moreover, when supplementary oscillators are used in these applications, we often have to deal with a situation where the primary vibration frequency is not known a priori. In such cases, we have to design a robust supplementary oscillator such that it is able to operate in a rather wide range of frequencies. A SMA-based oscillator is an ideal candidate for these purposes. In the present paper, we propose a dynamic nonlinear model and its numerical realization for using SMA oscillators as vibration absorbers. The system under consideration consists of a SMA rod and an end-mass. We demonstrate that due to the thermo-mechanical coupling, the vibration characteristics of the supplementary oscillator can be tuned by changing its temperature. The dynamic nonlinear model of the SMA oscillator is simplified for the vibration analysis and an efficient numerical methodology is proposed to evaluate the performance of the oscillator. It is demonstrated that the vibration of the primary system can be tuned within a rather wide frequency range by using the SMA oscillator. It is also shown that at high temperatures the performance of the oscillator is close to that of a linear oscillator, while at low temperatures, the SMA oscillator behaves as a regular damper by using its dissipation due to mechanically-induced phase transformations.}

abstract = {In this paper, the dynamics of martensitic transformations in shape memory alloy (SMA) constrained finite nanostructures is studied using a phase field model with the Ginzburg–Landau free energy. The nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical properties in SMAs have been extensively studied in the bulk case. However at the nanoscale the thermal physics has been usually neglected in a study of SMA properties, and most of the model developments have been carried out under the assumption of isothermal phase transformations. The main aim of this paper is to develop a model that couples the thermal physics and the mechanical dynamics to study the influence of such coupling on the mechanical properties of SMA nanostructures. The developed model is solved using the finite element method. Analyzing FePd alloy nanowires, we observe a steeper slope of the stress–strain curve in the coupled thermo-mechanical case due to temperature evolution during the loading–unloading cycle of such nanostructures. We also observe the martensitic suppression phenomenon in constrained nanowires and nanograins on cooling. We have developed a semi-analytical model to predict a critical size at the onset of martensitic suppression. The semi-analytical model predicts a critical size which is in a good agreement with the numerical results for FePd nanograins.}

The first order phase transformations and associated thermo-mechanical coupling effects are accounted for by employing the modified Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The effect of internal friction is considered by using a Rayleigh dissipation term. Chebyshev collocation method is employed together with the backward differentiation methods for numerical analysis. Numerical experiments are performed. Wave propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial temperatures. It is demonstrated that thermal waves will be induced. Phase transformations in the material will complicate their propagation patterns.

    abstract = { The Landau theory of phase transition has been successfully applied to solve a number of important problems in the dynamics of martensitic phase transformations in alloys. On the other hand, although a precise mathematical description of the microstructures is known within the framework of Cauchy-Born hypothesis, its discrete version is not well elucidated in the literature, especially for multivariant transformations in three-dimensional samples. A major reason for such a situation lies with computational difficulties connected with quasi-convexity of the associated minimization problem. In this paper we develop a Landau-Ginzburg free energy model for dynamic problems of phase transformations and show a possible link of the developed framework with the continuum description of phase transformations. We demonstrate how the precise description of compatible microstructures in the phase-field model can be used in computational finite element models. The developed framework is sufficiently general to be applied to different types of phase transforming alloys and under general thermo-mechanical loadings. We exemplify the developed technique and its finite element implementation on cubic to tetragonal transformations. }

We show how such assumptions can be removed to achieve unconditional convergence of the proposed scheme. Next, we apply the proposed scheme to the analysis of behaviour of a shape memory alloy rod. We demonstrate that the proposed approximation can describe a complete range of behaviour of the shape memory material, including quasiplastic, pseudoelastic, and almost elastic regimes. We discuss the influence of nonlinear effects in each of these regimes focusing on hysteresis effects.},

Our main objective in this paper is to study how this diffusion kinetics influences the stress-temperature induced dynamics of phase transformation in microscopic and larger length-scale without attempting to solve a molecular dynamic problem in a coupled manner.

abstract={Piezoelectric materials have the intrinsic reversible ability to convert a mechanical strain into an electric field and their applications touch our daily lives. However, the complex physical mechanisms linking mechanical and electrical properties make these materials hard to understand. Computationally onerous models have historically been unable to adequately describe dynamic phenomena inside real piezoelectric materials, and are often limited to over-simplified first-order analytical, quasi-static, or unsatisfying phenomenological numerical approaches. We present a generalized dynamic analytical model based on first-principles that is efficiently computable and better describes these exciting materials, including higher-order coupling effects. We illustrate the significance of this model by applying it to the important 3m crystal symmetry class of piezoelectric materials that includes lithium niobate, and show that the model accurately predicts the experimentally observed impedance spectrum. This dynamic behavior is a function of almost all intrinsic properties of the piezoelectric material, so that material properties, including mechanical, electrical, and dielectric coefficients, can be readily and simultaneously extracted for any size crystal, including at the nanoscale; the only prior knowledge required is the crystal class of the material system. In addition, the model's analytical approach is general in nature, and can increase our understanding of traditional and novel ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials, regardless of crystal size or orientation.},

	abstract = {While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson’s ratios (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling. We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently auxetic where we show an improvement of 40%–50% in the piezoelectric response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials. This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices. We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300% compared to non-auxetic reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with negative Poisson’s ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use of expensive nanomaterials.}

abstract = {Lead-free piezocomposites are an ecofriendly route for sensing and harvesting energy from mechanical stimuli and it is important to develop accurate models which can capture essential physical processes underlying their performance. Current piezocomposite design heavily relies on the linear piezoelectric model which neglects nonlocal and nonlinear electro-elastic processes. Here we develop a more accurate modelling paradigm to determine the contributions from nonlocal flexoelectric and nonlinear electrostrictive effects towards the performance of lead-free piezocomposites. We find that in the case of microscale randomly shaped piezoelectric inclusions which represent a practical scenario, the flexoelectric effect does not contribute appreciably towards the piezoelectric response. However, the nonlinear electrostrictive effects impart significant strain-dependent responses. Further, in nano-modified composites, we find that the nonlinear electro-mechanical coupling can have different effects on the transverse and the longitudinal electro-elastic responses. In particular, the longitudinal electric field response, with the nonlinear contribution, is less sensitive to the polycrystalline structure of the piezoelectric inclusions. These observations clearly indicate that at larger strains, nonlinear effects cannot be neglected. In general, our results entail that it is important to include nonlocal and nonlinear processes for reliable and accurate modelling of piezocomposites.}

abstract = {Improving the performance of lead-free piezocomposites to the levels of state-of-the-art lead-based composites has been an important challenge in composite research. Consequently, an important agenda of piezocomposite research has been to identify new coupled mechanisms that can enhance the piezoelectric response. One such method is to tap into the size-dependent flexoelectric phenomenon in geometrically anisotropic structures. Numerical models which can account for flexoelectricity and nonlinear effects such as electrostriction are not well-developed for piezocomposite design, and current designs are based on linear piezoelectric models. Here, we develop an advanced model with flexoelectric and electrostrictive contributions in geometrically tailored piezocomposites to obtain insights on aspects of enhanced response due to small-size effects. Here, based on design considerations, we numerically demonstrate that in epoxy-matrix-based piezocomposites which are structured as truncated pyramids, flexoelectricity can lead to significant enhancements in both the electric field and the electric flux generation at small length scales. Particularly, we show that at dilute inclusion concentrations, dramatic improvements nearing 150% in the piezoelectric response are possible. Further, the flexoelectric enhancement is sensitive to the packing of the inclusions within the composite structure with the best enhancements occurring when the inclusions are closer to the inclined edges of the pyramids. We also show that in composite structures with CNT-modified matrices, flexoelectricity produces similar enhancements as in the case of unmodified matrices, demonstrating that the effect operates almost independent of nanoscale elastic and dielectric modifications by the nanotubes. Finally, we also establish that for a large range of applied stresses, the nonlinear deviations in the response due to electrostriction are negligible and flexoelectricity is the predominant size-dependent enhancement mechanism in structured lead-free piezocomposites.}

Therefore, in the context of mechanically superior high-performance piezo-composites, graphene-modified composite architectures represent an important design direction. In this paper, we first develop an effective property model for graphene-modified piezoelectric matrices, taking into account the mechanical anisotropy of the matrix. We further evaluate the piezoelectric performance of the matrix architecture which incorporates lead-free BaTiO3 polycrystal inclusions. In order to obtain comparisons with well-established composites, we compare the electro-elastic response of two composite architectures in which the matrix is modified by multiwalled CNTs and graphene respectively. It is seen that, near percolation of the nano-additions, graphene-based systems exhibit an order of improvement in the piezoelectric response compared to the composite without nano modification. This improvement is comparable to CNT-based systems, but the matrix hardening is lesser than half the hardening observed in CNT-modified composites. This feature is due to a considerably smaller percolation threshold of graphene compared to CNTs which brings about percolative conditions at very small filler concentrations. We further investigate the dependence of the electric flux and fields in the graphene-modified piezocomposite on the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions to identify the polycrystalline configurations that can lead to improved performance in such nanomodified piezocomposites.}

	journal = {Smart Materials and Structures},
	abstract = {Lead-free piezoelectric composites with polymeric matrices offer a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer the performance of these materials through addition of higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely towards composite design and towards development of accurate effective property models. In the context of composite design, we evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves the electric field within the composite offering significant advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second aspect of this work is the development of an effective property model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not significantly affect the piezoresponse.}

	journal = {Smart Materials and Structures},
	abstract = {Piezoelectric composites are a class of smart materials which can be manufactured in a scalable manner by additive processes, while catering to a wide range of applications. Recent efforts are directed towards composites of lead-free piezoelectric materials with a goal of achieving performances comparable to lead-based composites. While there has been extensive research in fabrication methodologies such as 3D printing, which can manufacture complex piezoelectric structures in a scalable manner, there are important remaining questions as to how the performance of lead-free piezoelectric composites can be further improved. Fundamental to this is the understanding of key factors underlying piezoelectric performance: the electro-elastic interactions between the piezoelectric material and the matrix, the effects of the polycrystalline microstructure of the piezoelectric inclusions, the effect of randomly shaped polycrystalline fillers, and the effect of the volume fraction of the piezoelectric material in the matrix. A strong motivation for using polycrystalline fillers is that they can exhibit enhanced piezoelectric and mechanical properties compared to single crystalline materials. Moreover, polycrystalline materials are amenable to scalable manufacturing. We computationally investigate these important aspects of piezoelectric composite design and performance by taking into account for the first time the polycrystalline nature of lead-free piezoelectric inclusions, in the context of a matrix-inclusion composite. We achieve this by dispersing randomly shaped polycrystalline inclusions at random positions in the matrix which allows us to better understand the behavior of practical composite architectures. In such cases, our analysis reveals that although polycrystalline piezoelectric materials, in isolation, can outperform their single crystal counterparts, in a composite architecture these enhancements are not straightforward. We identify the sources of loss which prevent polycrystalline inclusions from enhancing the performance of the composites. By tuning the dielectric environment in the matrix through the inclusion of metallic nanoparticles, we demonstrate how the performance of the composites can be further significantly improved. Specifically, when the metal nanoparticles are near the percolation threshold, we show that polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions perform better than single crystals, with an improvement of around 14.6% in the effective piezoelectric response. We conclude that such novel architectures, devised by a combination of polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions in a high permittivity environment, can improve the performance of the composites beyond the single crystal design and thus offer a promising direction for 3D printable lead-free piezoelectric composites.}

Here, we build a modeling paradigm for improving the piezoelectric performance through improved matrices and optimal polycrystallinity in the piezoelectric inclusions. By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we demonstrate 2–3 orders of improvement in the piezoelectric response, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity. By tuning the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions, we show considerable improvements exceeding 50% in the piezo-response, compared to single crystal inclusions. We further analyze the influence of carbon nanotube agglomerations at supramolecular length scales, as well as vacancy defects in the nanotubes at the atomic level, on composite performance. Although nanomaterial agglomeration is conventionally considered undesirable, we show that, near nanotube percolation, clustering of nanotubes can lead to better matrix hardening and higher permittivities, leading to improvements exceeding 30% in the piezoelectric response compared to non-agglomerated architectures. We further demonstrate that although atomic vacancy defects in nanotubes effectively soften the matrix, this can be compensated by agglomeration of nanotubes at larger length-scales.}

In this article, the influence of different materials on the energy-harvesting performance associated with this new strategy is further studied. The state-of-the-art phase-field model is adopted to investigate the nonlinear hysteretic energy-harvesting process in two nanoscale ferroelectric energy harvesters, which are respectively based on two typical ferroelectric materials—single-crystal BaTiO3 and PbTiO3. In both cases, the effects of the bias voltage and bias resistance are carefully investigated and the optimum values are obtained. Later, the energy-harvesting process and energy flow details in both harvesters working at the optimum conditions are presented and carefully compared in the context of real applications. Furthermore, the energy-harvesting performance of a BaTiO3-based nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvester with equivalent material size is additionally simulated with the finite element method and compared with the corresponding results of the ferroelectric energy harvesters, where obvious advantages associated with the new strategy are demonstrated. }

The expressions are derived from orientational averages of third-order piezoelectric tensors of the individual crystals that are weighted by orientational distribution functions. The averaging is done by using generalized spherical harmonic series expansions. Improvements with respect to previous works in the literature are twofold: all crystal symmetries are considered and no symmetry restrictions are imposed to texture. The versatility of the introduced expressions is demonstrated on an example of BaTiO3 polycrystals with uniaxial and biaxial textures characterized by single and double Gaussian distributions, respectively. The results for uniaxial texture are in perfect agreement with the results published in the literature. The biaxial texture is discussed in detail and analyzed for a set of limiting cases.}

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract The phase-field method has recently emerged as a powerful computational approach to modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and microstructure evolution in materials. It describes a microstructure using a set of conserved and nonconserved field variables that are continuous across the interfacial regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the field variables is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the Allen-Cahn relaxation equation. With the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures without explicitly tracking the positions of interfaces. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in developing phase-field models for various materials processes including solidification, solid-state structural phase transformations, grain growth and coarsening, domain evolution in thin films, pattern formation on surfaces, dislocation microstructures, crack propagation, and electromigration. }

    abstract = { Suppressing the operating current in resistive memory devices is an effective strategy to minimize their power consumption. Herein, we present an intrinsic low-current memory based on two-dimensional (2D) hybrid heterostructures consisting of partly reduced graphene oxide (p-rGO) and conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) with the merits of being solution-processed, large-scale, and well patterned. The device with the heterostructure of p-rGO/CMP sandwiched between highly reduced graphene oxide (h-rGO) and aluminum electrodes exhibited rewritable and nonvolatile memory behavior with an ultralow operating current (∼1 μA) and efficient power consumption (∼2.9 μW). Moreover, the on/off current ratio is over 103, and the retention time is up to 8 × 103 s, indicating the low misreading rate and high stability of data storage. So far, the value of power is about 10 times lower than those of the previous GO-based memories. The bilayer architecture provides a promising approach to construct intrinsic low-power resistive memory devices. }

abstract = {Abstract 2D black phosphorus (BP) and MXenes have triggered enormous research interest in catalysis, energy storage, and chemical sensing. Unfortunately, the low stability of these materials under practical operating conditions remains a critical bottleneck, particularly as they are prone to oxidization under moisture. In this work, the design and application of stable 2D heterostructures obtained from decorating BP and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with few-layer holey graphene oxide (FHGO) membranes are presented. In the resulting heterostructured systems, FHGO serves as a multifunctional passivation layer that shields BP or MXene from oxidative degradation, while allowing the selective diffusion of target gas molecules through its micropores and toward the underlying 2D material. Through a case study of dilute NO2 sensing, it is demonstrated that these heterostructures show a greatly enhanced sensing performance under humid conditions, where fast sensing speed and response are consistently observed, and high stability is impressively retained upon repetitive sensing cycles for 1000 min. These results corroborate the efficacy of material decoration with porous FHGO membranes and suggest that this is a generalizable strategy for reliable high-performance applications of 2D materials.},

The induced spin splitting energy due to ripple waves can be further enhanced with increasing values of applied tensile edge stress for potential applications in straintronic devices.

We study the bandgap opening due to strain induced ripple waves and investigate the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields on the band structures and spin relaxation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that electron-hole bands of GNRs are highly influenced (i.e. level crossing of the bands are possible) by coupling two combined effects: pseudomagnetic fields (PMF) originating from strain tensor and external magnetic fields. In particular, we show that the tuning of the spin-splitting band extends to large externally applied magnetic fields with increasing values of pseudomagnetic fields. Level crossings of the bands in strained GNRs can also be observed due to the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields. We also investigate the influence of this interplay on the electromagnetic field mediated spin relaxation mechanism in GNRs. In particular, we show that the spin hot spot can be observed at approximately B = 65 T (the externally applied magnetic field) and B0 = 53 T (the magnitude of induced pseudomagnetic field due to ripple waves) which may not be considered as an ideal location for the design of straintronic devices. Our analysis might be used for tuning the bandgaps in strained GNRs and utilized to design the optoelectronic devices for straintronic applications.},

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

ABSTRACT={Graphene oxide (GO) is useful and promising material for graphene based applications in electronic, optics, chemistry, energy storage, and biology. At the beginning of graphene history GO was only a simple and cheap step for preparation of single and multilayer graphene films and bulk structures by reduction. The further studies revealed the substantial structure imperfection of graphene oxide derived materials due to the defects in initial graphite and incompletion of reducing process. However, the results of recent research demonstrated a great amount of unique chemical, optical and electronic properties of graphene oxide that allow regarding it as independent nanomaterial possessing a large area of applications. In general, it represents the ultra-large organic molecule containing 2D carbon mesh. Unlike conventional graphene it provides wide range of chemical methods for attachment of various functional groups to its surface for control optical transparency, electrical and thermal conductance. Recently developed methods for preparation of graphene oxide derivatives saturated by carboxyl groups open the new attractive application areas in green technologies including energy storage and utilizing nuclear wastes. The goal of the review is to summarize the results of recent studies of graphene oxide, derivatives and reveal the most promising directions to focus the efforts of researchers.}

abstract={With growing demands of energy and enormous consumption of fossil fuels, the world is in dire need of a clean and renewable source of energy. Hydrogen (H2) is the best alternative, owing to its high calorific value (144 MJ/kg) and exceptional mass-energy density. Being an energy carrier rather than an energy source, it has an edge over other alternate sources of energy like solar energy, wind energy, and tidal energy, which require a constant energy source dependent upon weather conditions. However, its utilization as an energy carrier has not yet been commercialized due to its poor storage performance, which is attributed to low gravimetric and volumetric densities of adsorbed hydrogen at ambient temperature and technological limitations in meeting the stringent parameters set by Department of Energy, USA. With exceptionally large surface area (2630 m2/g), porous nature, lightweight, and high chemical and thermal stability (melting point {\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}4510 K) along with the possibility of economical and scalable production, graphene-based solid-state porous materials have shown promising applications in efficient hydrogen storage. In this context, the present review discusses the recent advances and progress on the utilization of functionalized graphene, graphene oxide, and its derivatives for effective storage of hydrogen, along with important theoretical advancements via DFT calculations, first-principle calculations, and Monte Carlo Simulations, etc. Pristine graphene has poor hydrogen storage characteristics, and addition of dopants like boron and nitrogen or decoration by transition metals significantly improves the performance. In addition, graphene allows the tuning of surface curvature which can help in achieving a reversible hydrogen storage system with fast kinetics. The impact of external stimuli like electric field and strain on electronic structure of graphene is discussed with the applicability in achieving a highly controllable adsorption--desorption system. Finally, the review concludes with life cycle assessment of graphene-engineered composites for effective hydrogen storage applications, along with their energy and environmental implications.},

ABSTRACT = {The adhesion enhancement of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer in the underlying polyethersulfone (PES) microfiltration membrane is a crucial step towards developing a high-performance membrane for water purification applications. In the present study, we modified the surface of a PES microfiltration membrane with plasma treatment (PT) carried out at different times (2, 10, and 20 min). We studied the effect of PT on the adhesion, stability, and performance of the synthesized GO/rGO-PES membranes. The membranes&rsquo; surface morphology and chemistry were characterized using atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The membrane performance was evaluated by conducting a diffusion test for potassium chloride (KCl) ions through the synthesized membranes. The results revealed that the 2 min PT enhanced the adhesion and stability of the deposited GO/rGO layer when compared to the other plasma-treated membranes. This was associated with an increase in the KCl ion rejection from ~27% to 57%. Surface morphology analysis at a high magnification was performed for the synthesized membranes before and after the diffusion test. Although the membrane&rsquo;s rejection was improved, the analysis revealed that the GO layers suffered from micro/nano cracks, which negatively affected the membrane&rsquo;s overall performance. The use of the rGO layer, however, helped in minimizing the GO cracks and enhanced the KCl ion rejection to approximately 94%. Upon increasing the number of rGO deposition cycles from three to five, the performance of the developed rGO-PES membrane was further improved, as confirmed by the increase in its ion rejection to ~99%.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, graphene oxide (GO)/ethylene glycol (EG) membranes were designed by a vacuum filtration method for molecular separation and water purification. The composite membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The interlayer spacing of GO membranes (0.825 nm) and GO/EG membranes (0.634 nm) are measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Using the vacuum filtration method, the membrane thickness can be controlled by selecting the volume of the solution from which the membrane is prepared, to achieve high water permeance and high rejection of Rhodamine B (RhB). The membrane performance was evaluated on a dead-end filtration device. The water permeance and rejection of RhB of the membranes are 103.35 L m&minus;2 h&minus;1 bar&minus;1 and 94.56% (GO), 58.17 L m&minus;2 h&minus;1 bar&minus;1 and 97.13% (GO/EG), respectively. The permeability of GO/EG membrane is about 40 &times; 10&minus;6 L m-1 h&minus;1 bar&minus;1. Compared with the GO membrane, the GO/EG membrane has better separation performance because of its proper interlayer spacing. In this study, the highest rejection of RhB (99.92%) is achieved. The GO/EG membranes have potential applications in the fields of molecular separation and water purification.},

    abstract = { Poly(l-lactide-co-$\epsilon$-aprolactone) is an environment-friendly shape memory polymer. Molecular dynamics method was used to study the shape memory effect and mechanical properties of graphene oxide–reinforced poly(l-lactide-co-$\epsilon$-aprolactone) to understand the microscopic mechanism. Two models containing dispersed graphene oxide were constructed. It is shown that the addition of graphene oxide causes the glass transition temperature of material to rise because of limitation on polymer activity. The uniaxial tensile properties of the composites were studied. The results exhibited that strength of composites depend on the interface state of the polymer and graphene oxide. The strength of the composite with covalent bond is much higher than that of another without the covalent bond between graphene oxide and poly(l-lactide-co-$\epsilon$-aprolactone)) generated. Stress softening effect was observed in the cross-linked composite in the glass state. Their uniaxial tension thermodynamic cycles were carried out to consider the shape memory effect of the composites. It is shown that graphene oxide–reinforced composites with different interactions exhibit fair shape memory effect in the direction of paralleling graphene oxide surface. In terms of the direction perpendicular to graphene oxide sheet, the fixed ratios of the composites decrease slightly about 1.64\%–3.63\%, and the recovery ratios of the composites with the covalent bond are higher than others about 3.22\%–12.93\%. }

abstract = {Abstract Significant research to define and standardize terminologies for describing stacks of atomic layers in bulk graphene materials has been undertaken. Most methods to measure the stacking characteristics are time consuming and are not suited for obtaining information by directly imaging dispersions. Conventional optical microscopy has difficulty in identifying the size and thickness of a few layers of graphene stacks due to their low photon absorption capacity. Utilizing a contrast based on anisotropic refractive index in 2D materials, it is shown that localized thickness-specific information can be captured in birefringence images of graphene dispersions. Coupling pixel-by-pixel information from brightfield and birefringence images and using unsupervised statistical learning algorithms, three unique data clusters representing flakes (unexfoliated), nanoplatelets (partially exfoliated), and 2D sheets (well-exfoliated) species in various laboratory-based and commercial dispersions of graphene and graphene oxide are identified. The high-throughput, multitasking capability of the approach to classify stacking at sub-nanometer to micrometer scale and measure the size, thickness, and concentration of exfoliated-species in generic dispersions of graphene/graphene oxide are demonstrated. The method, at its current stage, requires less than half an hour to quantitatively assess one sample of graphene/graphene oxide dispersion.},

Using 20 396 random configurations relaxed at the electronic structure level, we observe the presence of hydroxyl, ether, double bonds, aliphatic (cyclohexane) disruption, defects and significant out-of-plane distortions that go beyond the Lerf–Klinowski model. Based on an diverse list of 224 chemical, structural and topological features we identify 25 archetypal ‘pure’ graphene oxide structures which capture all of the complexity and diversity of the entire data set; and three prototypes that are the truly representative averages in 224-dimensional space. Together these 28 structures, which are shown to be largely robust against changes in thermochemical conditions modeled using ab initio thermodynamics, can be downloaded and used collectively as a small data set for with a fraction of the computational cost in future work, or independently as an exemplar of graphene oxide with the required oxidation.}

abstract={Graphene oxides have exhibited alluring potential for state-of-the-art applications such as biomedical devices and functional nanocomposites. The types and concentrations of oxygen-containing functional groups are fingerprints of graphene oxides, dictating the properties and usage of the nanomaterial. Compared to pure graphene, the properties of graphene oxides are more challenging to model from a theoretical perspective, mainly because of the profound but implicit influences of the functional groups within. Machine learning is a potent method to uncover the hidden structure--property relations and to accelerate material discovery. Here, we develop a machine learning-based strategy to determine the functionalization properties of monolayer graphene oxides, labeled by the oxygen-to-carbon ratio and relative concentrations of functional groups. Trained by mechanical responses upon uniaxial tension computed by reactive molecular dynamics simulations, our proposed gradient boosting machine learning model can accurately identify the chemical composition of graphene oxides in the reserved data set. The difference in prediction accuracies between oxygen coverage and functional group composition is rationalized by graphene oxide molecular mechanisms. The proposed data-driven strategy can contribute to the predictive modeling of functionalized two-dimensional materials of a broad variety.},

Using suitable choice of reaction parameters including temperature and time, this recipe does not require expensive membranes for filtration of carbonaceous and metallic residues. A pre-cooling protocol is introduced to control the explosive nature of the highly exothermic reactions during the oxidation process. This alleviates the requirement for expensive membranes and completely eliminates the explosive nature of intermediate reaction steps when compared to existing methods. High quality of the synthesized GO is corroborated using a host of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and current-voltage characteristics. Simple reduction protocol using ultra-violet light is demonstrated for potential application in the area of photovoltaics. Using different reduction protocols together with the proposed inexpensive method, reduced GO samples with tunable conductance over a wide range of values is demonstrated. Density functional theory is employed to understand the structure of GO. We anticipate that this scalable approach will catalyze large scale applications of GO.},

A variety of influencing factors on the concentration of graphene/graphene oxide nanosheets are systematically explored, indicating that this method is easy to scale up. A series of characterizations prove that the graphene can be successfully exfoliated with the help of graphite oxide, and graphene can effectively combine with graphene oxide. The composites exhibit better electrochemical properties (gravimetric capacitance of 483 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) than materials built with the mixture of graphene, graphene oxide, and polyaniline as precursors. In addition, the symmetric supercapacitor which is assembled from the composites demonstrates a high energy density of 17.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. These results show that graphene/graphene oxide nanosheets have a good application in supercapacitors.}

The EPD parameters voltage and deposition time were varied to deposit uniform adherent coatings. The coatings were post heat treated at 200 °C in vacuum for 4h to assess the effect on coated samples. GO and GO-EPD coating morphology were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Linear polarization (LPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed in saline solution to evaluate electrochemical response. Coatings were partially reduced due to removal of oxygen containing functional groups during EPD and post heat treatments. The GO post heat treated coating had better corrosion resistance ~2 times than that of bare mild steel and higher charge transfer resistance.}

Synthesis of graphene nanomaterial is performed to obtain graphene oxide (GO) using the modified Hummers method. Oxides in GO are reduced to get reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using Cedrus deodara (CD) tree's leaf extract. Physical characterisation of the prepared GO and CD-rGO is done to ascertain their properties, viz, internal pore surface area, average pore diameter, etc. Solid electrodes are fabricated from the prepared powdered samples of GO and CD-rGO, and later tested in an MRPEM fuel cell. Electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of GO and CD-rGO is found to be 1.21 and 2.7 wt\%, respectively. It is successfully demonstrated that hydrogen ions could be stored in a porous graphene electrode and recovered back. The obtained results are analysed to draw a relation between physical characteristics of graphene and electrochemical hydrogen adsorption. It is found that higher internal pore surface area attracts more hydrogen storage in ionic form. This research work is a maiden attempt to show, experimentally, the physical/chemical adsorption of hydrogen in graphene when employed in a reversible PEM fuel cell. This surely could contribute towards the development of a safe and efficient alternate powering source with many potential applications.},

The structural and chemical analysis of the EDAC-GO indicate GO reduction during its modification, suggesting that the oxygen functional groups in pristine GO, particularly carboxyl moieties are the responsible for the dispersion and interactions with the polymer and the improvement in mechanical properties.}

ABSTRACT = {Shape-memory composites have benefits for minimally invasive surgery, but their wider applications for bone repair are hindered by conflicts between the mechanical and memory performances, especially at load-bearing locations. In this study, we fabricated a graphene oxide shape-memory polyurethane composite through the chemical combination of graphene oxide and isocyanate, in order to realize satisfactory mechanical and shape-memory effects. As desired, a modulus of ~339 MPa and a shape recovery ratio of 98% were achieved, respectively, in the composite. In addition, finite element analysis demonstrated that, after being implanted in a defective bone through a minimally invasive treatment, where the highest stress was distributed at the implant&ndash;bone interface, this composite could offer a generated force during the recovery process. Furthermore, we also discuss the origins of the improved mechanical and memory properties of the composites, which arise from increased net-points and the stable molecular structure inside. Therefore, with its superior structure and properties, we envision that this shape-memory composite can provide new insights toward the practical application of shape-memory polymers and composites in the field of bone repair.},

ABSTRACT = {Considerable attention has been drawn for fabricating novel systems imitating natural structures, but progress remains slow in the practical applications. In this direction, hydrogel films with a nacre-like structure based on Chitosan (CS) and Graphene Oxide (GO) have been synthesized with metal ion crosslinking. Several characterization techniques were utilized for establishing the successful synthesis and optimization of the hydrogel films. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy distinctly confirms Mg2+ ion coordination with the layers of GO. SEM images depict the nacre-like layered structure of the metal ion crosslinked hydrogels. Enhanced thermal properties observed is due to the metal ion crosslinking. The pH-responsive behavior of the films is revealed by the swelling study performed for the hydrogels in basic, water, and acidic media. Incorporation of metal ion inside the gel film has rendered improved mechanical properties to the film. Mimicking the strength of natural costal cartilage, the elongation at break and tensile strength of the metal ion modified hydrogel films are found to be 2.51% and 38.0 MPa, respectively. The hydrogel films are found to have 84% increase in tensile strength and 83% increase in Young’s modulus. The gel films exhibit remarkable shape memory behavior at around 25°C in alcoholic solutions.},

abstract={Hand is one of the most flexible and useful organs of the human body. However, cases of hand function loss due to diseases and accidents abound, which brings a lot of inconvenience to patients{\&}{\#}x2019; lives. This paper introduced a flexible hand movement device (HMD) driven by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, which is compact, lightweight, and easy to use during activities of daily living (ADL). Firstly, we elaborated the design and modelling process, including the driving analysis of SMA wires. Secondly, the manufacturing process and testing method of the HMD are presented. Thirdly, the results of the experiment are discussed in detail. Through the experiment, we obtained the bending angle and operating space of fingers. Moreover, the joint angle as well as the fingertip force can be controlled using PWM. A maximum angular movement of 45{\&}{\#}xb0;, 62{\&}{\#}xb0;, and 71{\&}{\#}xb0; can be generated at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) of a finger using an SMA wire, respectively. Then, the operating space of the entire hand can be calculated based on the experimental results. Besides, an estimated 40{\&}{\#}x2009;N of grasping force can be produced for a whole hand. In conclusion, this research indicates that the finger movement driven by the HMD is similar to a healthy person, which can meet the needs of ADL.},

  title = {An accurate dynamic model for polycrystalline shape memory alloy wire actuators and sensors},
  journal = {Smart Materials and Structures},
  abstract = {Thermal shape memory alloy (SMA) wires exhibit a mechanical hysteresis of which the shape depends on both temperature and loading rate. Commercially available actuator wires typically exhibit polycrystalline behavior, which also depends on training effects. Polycrystallinity may lead to complex hysteresis loops, differing substantially from standard box shapes often employed in modeling attempts. In addition, actuation often results in loading trajectories leading through the interior of the hysteresis, making accurate modeling and control of SMA systems a highly challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic model for polycrystalline SMA actuator wires based on a modified version of the Müller–Achenbach–Seelecke model. The model permits to predict time evolution of stress and resistance of a one-dimensional SMA wire under arbitrary input strain and Joule heating profiles. The constitutive equations are developed by properly exploiting the concept of a representative single-crystal, resulting in an optimal trade-off between physical interpretation and computational efficiency. After developing constitutive model equations, experimental validation is performed by means of two case studies, given by a superelastic NiTi wire and a quasi-plastic NiTi wire, respectively. The experiments are intended to illustrate the model capabilities in predicting internal hysteresis loops, loading rate effects, as well as actuation and sensing behavior at the same time. A remarkable accuracy is observed in all of the investigated experimental scenarios, making the model particularly suitable for high-precision control and self-sensing applications.}

The temperature-inner force relationship obeys a hybrid structure in which a sigmoid function correlates the variation of temperature for the SMA and the force executed by the spring actuator. The hybrid nature of the model describes the regular hysteresis behavior of the SMA. The switching law of the hybrid model depends on the time derivative of the temperature. A multivariable model depending on temperature, and inner and external forces was developed in order to characterize the Shape Memory Effect (SME). A set of experiments was carried out to obtain the parameters used to characterize the model. The application of the Levenberg-Marquardt method resulted in the parametric estimation procedure. An averaged correlation factor of 0.95 between the model response and experimental results justifies the proposed modeling approach.}

ABSTRACT = {Data-driven modeling provides an efficient approach to compute approximate solutions for complex multiphysics parametrized problems such as induction hardening (IH) process. Basically, some physical quantities of interest (QoI) related to the IH process will be evaluated under real-time constraint, without any explicit knowledge of the physical behavior of the system. Hence, computationally expensive finite element models will be replaced by a parametric solution, called metamodel. Two data-driven models for temporal evolution of temperature and austenite phase transformation, during induction heating, were first developed by using the proper orthogonal decomposition based reduced-order model followed by a nonlinear regression method for temperature field and a classification combined with regression for austenite evolution. Then, data-driven and hybrid models were created to predict hardness, after quenching. It is shown that the results of artificial intelligence models are promising and provide good approximations in the low-data limit case.},

However, being a nascent field there is little knowledge on the shape recovery behaviour of laminates with an SMP film and there are only methods reported in the literature for quantifying the material behaviour. Through various experimental data gathering and analysis, influences of different variables that affect the recovery behaviour of thermoplastic shape memory polyurethanes based laminates including ambient temperature, material modulus, and adhesive strength have been investigated to develop a physical model to formulate the recovery behaviour of the material. It has been identified that a fundamental optimisation problem that needs to be solved is to maximize the final angle recovery ratios and recovery rates of a material to increase the overall efficiency of a targeted SMP material. In this study, we present early results on using data-driven machine learning to learn and predict deformation characteristics of such SMP laminates without explicit knowledge of the internal constitution of the laminar SMP material. Such data-driven approaches can be rapidly applied as a characterization tool for novel SMP material and shapes without having to perform complex physical modeling of material properties and structural influences to the foil deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the concept of scalability for actuators is introduced and explored, which is the capability to freely change the output characteristics on demand: displacement and force for a linear actuator, angular position and torque for a rotational actuator. This change can either be used to obtain power improvement (with a constant scale factor), or to improve the usability of a robotic system according to variable conditions (with a variable scale factor). Some advantages of a scalable design include the ability to adapt to changing environments, variable resolution of step size, ability to produce designs that are adequate for restricted spaces or that require strict energy efficiency, and intrinsically safe systems. Current approaches for scalability in actuators have shortcomings: the method to achieve scalability is complex, so obtaining a variable scaling factor is challenging, or they cannot scale both output characteristics simultaneously. Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire-based actuators can overcome these limitations, because its two output characteristics, displacement and force, are physically independent from each other. In this paper we present a novel design concept for linear scalable actuators that overcome SMA design and scalability limitations by using a variable number of SMA wires mechanically in parallel, immersed in a liquid that transmits heat from a separate heat source (wet activation). In this concept, more wires increase the maximum attainable force, and longer wires increase the maximum displacement. Prototypes with different number of SMA wires were constructed and tested in isometric experiments to determine force vs. temperature behavior and time response. The heat-transmitting liquid was either static or flowing using pumps. Scalability was achieved with a simple method in all tested prototypes with a linear correlation of maximum force to number of SMA wires. Flowing heat transmission achieved higher actuation bandwidth.},

abstract={Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest due to the typically enhanced mechanical properties, which enables plenty of novel applications. In this paper, by employing first-principles calculations, we report the emergence of NPR in a class of two-dimensional honeycomb structures (graphene, silicene, h-BN, h-GaN, h-SiC, and h-BAs), which are distinct from all other known auxetic materials. They share the same mechanism for the emerged NPR despite the different chemical composition, which lies in the increased bond angle ($\theta$). However, the increase of $\theta$ is quite intriguing and anomalous, which cannot be explained in the traditional point of view of the geometry structure and mechanical response, for example, in the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulations based on empirical potential. We attribute the counterintuitive increase of $\theta$ and the emerged NPR fundamentally to the strain-modulated electronic orbital coupling and hybridization. It is proposed that the NPR phenomenon can also emerge in other nanostructures or nanomaterials with similar honeycomb structure. The physical origin as revealed in our study deepens the understanding on the NPR and would shed light on future design of modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special functions based on auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.},

The present study proposes the use of Extrusion Based Additive Manufacturing (EBAM, a.k.a. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)) to create a Shape Memory Polymer Composites (SMPC) that is electrically activated. The presented work investigates SMPC's motion trigger by a voltage application via studying a unit cell. This unit cell can be printed consecutively in the thickness or width direction to produce a large repetitive structure and satisfy dimensional requirements. A control unit was designed and manufactured specifically for this SMPC. The developed controller regulates power input to the composite in order to characterize the material's heating behaviour despite variations in resistance caused by changes in strain or temperature during the activation and use of the 4D printed SMPC. Different geometries of unit cells were analyzed to describe heat dissipation within the SMPC. The proposed technology enables exciting possibilities for 4D printed materials. As an example, the aforementioned resistance measurements of the proposed system can be used to correlate change in strain that has occurred in the SMPC during the recovery process, like a structural health monitoring system. The proposed technology has the potential to manufacture any intricate geometry of an actuator or sensor, such as the leg of a crawling robot; in which different leg designs may be programmed to change the dynamics of the robot. This is just one of the many applications that this material could have, other uses include the development of sports equipment such as a deployable kayak, use on wings for glider micro aerial vehicles, among others.}

abstract = {In this work, we present a reduction procedure for 3D models describing phase transformations in copper-based shape memory alloys (SMAs) and develop a robust numerical algorithm for the computational analysis of thin single-crystal slabs of these alloys. Starting from a general Landau-type 3D model for the SMA dynamics we have developed a new mathematical “slow manifold” model that allows us to describe effectively the main features of the thermomechanical behaviour of CuAlNi alloys. Results of the mathematical modelling of the thermomechanical fields in CuAlNi SMAs are discussed with numerical examples.}

abstract = {We present three-dimensional simulations of the microstructure and mechanical response of shape memory alloys undergoing cubic to tetragonal transitions, using FePd as an example. The simulations are based on a nonlinear elastic free-energy in terms of the appropriate strain fields. The dynamics is simulated by force balance equations for the displacement fields with a damping term derived from a dissipation function. Stress–strain properties in the pseudoelastic as well as the shape memory regime are investigated using strain loading. We also study the effects of defect-induced heterogeneous nucleation and motion of twin boundaries during deformation. Thus, we probe the influence of the microstructure on the mechanical response and investigate how the stress–strain behavior changes as a function of strain rate.}
